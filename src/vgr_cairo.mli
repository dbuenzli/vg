(** Vg {{:http://cairographics.org/}Cairo} renderer. *)

(** {1:target Cairo render targets} *)

val target : Cairo.context -> [`Other] Vg.Vgr.target
(** [target ctx] is a render target for rendering to the Cairo
    context [ctx]. Rendering a {{!Vg.Vgr.renderable}renderable}
    [(size, view, i)] is done as follows.
    {ol
    {- The context's current state is saved using {!Cairo.save}.}
    {- The context's is clipped to [Box2.v P2.o size]. This
       box is cleared with {!Color.void} and the portion
       [view] of [i] is rendered in this box.}
    {- The context's initial state is restored using {!Cairo.restore}}}
    Nothing else is done to [ctx].

    {b Multiple images.} Multiple images rendering is supported.  For
    each renderable the above procedure is performed on [ctx]. If you
    want to have each renderable on a single page on backends that support
    it you should handle this between two renderable using Cairo's API. *)

val stored_target : [< `Pdf | `Png of Gg.V2.t | `Ps | `Svg ] ->
  Vg.Vgr.dst_stored Vg.Vgr.target
(** [stored_target fmt] is a [fmt] render target for rendering to
    the stored destination given to {!Vg.Vgr.create}. For [`Png]
    the argument specifies the rendering resolution in samples
    per meters.

    {b Multiple images.} Multiple image rendering is supported on
    [`Pdf] and [`Ps] target, each renderable creates a new page of the
    renderable size. Multiple image rendering is not supported on
    [`Png] and [`Svg] and [Invalid_argument] is raised by
    {!Vg.Vgr.render} if multiple images are rendered. *)

(** {1:text Text rendering}

    {b Warning.} The following is subject to change in the future.

    Currently text rendering uses Cairo's font selection mechanism
    and doesn't support the glyph API.

    Given a glyph cut:

{!Vg.I.cut_glyphs}[ ~text ~blocks ~advances font glyphs]

    The [blocks], [advances] and [glyphs] parameters are ignored.
    [text] must be provided and is used to define the text to render.
    [font] is used to select the font family.

    The weight is limited to Normal ([< `W700]) and Bold ([>= `W700]).

    {1:limits Render warnings and limitations}

    The following render warnings are reported.
    {ul
    {- [`Unsupported_cut (`O o, i)], outline area cuts can be performed
       only on (possibly transformed) {!Vg.I.const}, {!Vg.I.axial} and
       {!Vg.I.radial} images.}
    {- [`Unsupported_glyph_cut (`O o, i)], outline glyph cuts can be
       performed only on (untransformed) {!Vg.I.const}, {!Vg.I.axial}
       and {!Vg.I.radial} images.}
    {- [`Textless_glyph_cut i] if no [text] argument is specified in a
       glyph cut.}}

    The following limitations should be taken into account.
    {ul
    {- In Cairo, the gradient color interpolation is performed
       in (non-linear) sRGB space. This doesn't respect Vg's semantics.}} *)
