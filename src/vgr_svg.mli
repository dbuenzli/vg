(** Vg SVG renderer.

    {b References.}
    {ul {- Erik DahlstrÃ¶m et al. {{:http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/}{e
    Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.1}}, 2011.}} *)

(** {1:target SVG render targets} *)

val target : ?xml_decl:bool -> ?xmp:string ->unit ->
  Vg.Vgr.dst_stored Vg.Vgr.target
(** [target xml_decl xmp ()] is an SVG render target for rendering to the
    stored destination given to {!Vg.Vgr.create}.
    {ul
    {- [xml_decl], if [true] (default) the
       {{:http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-XMLDecl}XML declaration} is
       output.}
    {- [xmp] is an optional UTF-8 encoded XML XMP metadata packet describing
       the SVG document (see ISO 16684-1 or the equivalent
        {{:http://www.adobe.com/devnet/xmp.html}Adobe spec.}).
       The convenience function {!Vg.Vgr.xmp} can be used to
       generate a packet.}}

    {b Multiple images.} Multiple image renders on the target are not
    supported. [Invalid_argument] is raised by {!Vg.Vgr.render} if multiple
    images are rendered. *)

(** {1:text Text rendering}

    {b Warning.} The following is subject to change in the future.

    Currently text rendering uses SVG's CSS font selection mechanism
    and doesn't support the glyph API.

    Given a glyph cut:

{!Vg.I.cut_glyphs}[ ~text ~blocks ~advances font glyphs]

    The [blocks], [advances] and [glyphs] parameters are ignored.
    [text] must be provided and is used to define the text to render.
    [font] is used to select the font in a CSS stylesheet. *)

(** {1:limits Render warnings and limitations}

    The following render warnings are reported.
    {ul
    {- [`Unsupported_cut (`O o, i)], outline area cuts can be performed
       only on (possibly transformed) {!Vg.I.const}, {!Vg.I.axial} and
       {!Vg.I.radial} images.}
    {- [`Unsupported_glyph_cut (a, i)], glyph cuts can be performed
       only on (untransformed) {!Vg.I.const}, {!Vg.I.axial} and
       {!Vg.I.radial} images.}
    {- [`Textless_glyph_cut i] if no [text] argument is specified in a
       glyph cut.}}

    The following limitations should be taken into account.
    {ul
    {- Generated SVG files do specify that gradient interpolation
       must be done in linear sRGB space, however many SVG viewers
       do not respect that directive (e.g. most browsers).}} *)
