(** Vg HTML canvas renderer.

(** {1:target HTML canvas render targets} *)

val screen_resolution : Gg.v2
(** [screen_resolution] is the screen resolution in pixels per meters. *)

val target :
  ?resize:bool -> ?resolution:Gg.v2 -> 'a -> [`Other] Vg.Vgr.target
(** [target resize resolution c] is a render target for rendering to the
    canvas element [c] (you need to make sure this is an
    {{:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement}
    HTMLCanvasElement} JavaScript object otherwise a runtime error will
    occur).
    {ul
    {- [resize] if [true] (default) sets the canvas CSS size to the
       physical size of {{!Vg.Vgr.renderable}renderables}. If [false]
       the physical size of renderables is ignored and the view
       rectangle is simply mapped on the canvas CSS size at the given
       resolution but {b WARNING} for this to work do not use any
       CSS [border] on the canvas element ([outline] can be used though)
       as it interacts badly with the underlying canvas size computation
       made by [Vgr_htmlc] (a typical symptom will be a vertically growing
       canvas on redraws, this seems to happen regardless of [box-sizing]).}
    {- [resolution], specifies the rendering resolution in samples per
       meters. If unspecified the {!screen_resolution} is used in both
       dimensions.}}

    {b Multiple images.} Multiple images render on the target is supported.
    Each new render clears the HTML canvas. *)

(** {1:text Text rendering}

    Text rendering uses the HTML canvas CSS font selection mechanism.
    As there is no control over glyph rendering in the HTML canvas,
    the glyph API is unsupported.

    Given a glyph cut:

{!Vg.I.cut_glyphs}[ ~text ~blocks ~advances font glyphs]

    The [blocks], [advances] and [glyphs] parameters are ignored.
    [text] must be provided and is used to define the text to render.
    [font] is used to select the font in the CSS stylesheet. Make sure
    that the fonts you use are embedded and {b loaded} in your DOM via
    [\@font-face].

    At the moment the renderer also needs to work around a particular
    browser bug which means that glyph cuts are currently limited to
    non-outline area cuts in {!I.const} images.  *)

(** {1:limits Render warnings and limitations}

    The following render warnings are reported.
    {ul
    {- [`Unsupported_cut ((`O o), i)], outline area cuts can be performed
       only on (possibly transformed) {!I.const}, {!I.axial} and {!I.radial}
       primitive images.}
    {- [`Unsupported_glyph_cut (a, i)], glyph cuts can be performed only
       on bare {!I.const} primitive images and outline area glyph cuts are
       currently unsupported.}
    {- [`Textless_glyph_cut i] if no [text] argument is specified in a glyph
       cut.}
    {- [`Other _] if dashes are rendered but unsupported by the browser.}}

    The following limitations should be taken into account.
    {ul
    {- The even-odd area rule is supported according to the
       latest whatwg spec. This may not work in all browsers.}
    {- In the HTML canvas gradient color interpolation is performed
       in (non-linear) sRGB space. This doesn't respect Vg's semantics.}} *)
