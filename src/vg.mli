(** Declarative 2D vector graphics.

    [Vg] is a declarative 2D vector graphics library. In [Vg], images
    are {{!Vg.image}values} that denote functions mapping points of
    the cartesian plane to colors. The library provides
    {{!Vg.I}combinators} to define and compose them. Renderers for
    {{!Vgr_pdf}PDF}, {{!Vgr_svg}SVG} and the HTML {{!Vgr_htmlc}canvas}
    are distributed with the library. An API allows to implement
    new renderers.

    Consult the {{!basics}basics}, the {{!semantics}semantics} and
     {{!examples}examples}.

    Open the module to use it, this defines only modules and types in

      [cut_glyphs area text blocks advances font glyphs i] is like

      The origin of the first glyph is set to [P2.o], the origin of
      each subsequent glyph in [glyphs] is offset by the advance
      vector of the previous glyph as provided by [font]. Advance
      vectors for each glyph can be overriden by providing their value
      in [advances], if the length of [advances] is smaller than
      [glyphs] the rendering results are undefined.

      If provided the [text] parameter indicates the UTF-8 text
      corresponding to the sequence of glyphs. This may be used by
      certain renderer to allow text search in the result or to draw
      the text if it lacks control over glyph rendering (in which case
      an empty list of glyphs may be passed).

      If provided [blocks] is used to specify a sequential map between
      [glyphs] and the characters of [text]. The number of elements in
      the list defines the number of blocks. Starting at the head of
      each sequence, each block [(char_adv, glyph_adv)] indicates the
      number of characters and glyphs that make the next block (one or
      the other may be 0). If the boolean is [true] the glyph sequence
      is reversed for peforming the map. If [blocks] is unspecified a
      one to one map between glyphs and characters is assumed with
      undefined results if the number of glyphs and characters differ.

      If [area] is provided, the outline area of the glyphs are cut as
      specified, otherwise the area of the glyphs is determined as
      mandated by the font. {b Warning.} Backend support is poor
      this may be removed in the future. *)

(** {1:basics Basics}

    [Vg] is designed to be opened in your module. This defines only
    types and modules in your scope. Thus to use [Vg] start with :
{[
open Gg
open Vg
]}
    {!Gg} gives us types for points ({!Gg.p2}), vectors ({!Gg.v2}), 2D
    extents ({!Gg.size2}), rectangles ({!Gg.box2}) and colors
    ({!Gg.color}). Later you may want to read {!Gg}'s documentation
    {{!Gg.basics}basics} but for now it is sufficient to know that each of these
    types has a constructor [v] in a module named after the
    capitalized type name ({!Gg.P2.v}, {!Gg.V2.v}, etc.).

    {2:collage A collage model}

    Usual vector graphics libraries follow a {e painter model} in
    which paths are filled, stroked and blended on top of each other
    to produce a final image. [Vg] departs from that, it has a {e
    collage model} in which paths define 2D areas in infinite images
    that are {e cut} to define new infinite images to be blended on
    top of each other.

    The collage model maps very well to a declarative imaging model.
    It is also very clear from a specification point of view, both
    mathematically and metaphorically. This cannot be said from the
    painter model where the semantics of an operation like stroking a
    self-intersecting translucent path —  which usually applies the
    paint only once —  doesn't directly map to the underlying paint
    stroke metaphor. The collage model is also more economical from a
    conceptual point view since image cuts and blends naturally unify
    the distinct concepts of clipping paths, path strokes, path fills
    and compositing groups (unsupported for now in [Vg]) of the
    painter model.

    The collage model introduced in the following sections was stolen
    and adapted from the following works.

    {2:infinite Infinite images}

    Images in [Vg] are immutable and abstract value of type
    {!image}. {e Conceptually}, images are seen as functions mapping
    points of the infinite 2D plane to colors:

    [type Vg.image ] ≈  [Gg.p2 -> Gg.color]

    The simplest image is a constant image: an image that associates
    the same color to every point in the plane. For a constant
    gray of intensity 0.5 this would be expressed by the function:
{[
fun _ -> Color.gray 0.5
]}
    In [Vg] the combinator {!I.const} represents constant infinite images
    and the above function is written:
{[
let gray = I.const (Color.gray 0.5)
]}
    The module {!I} contains all the combinators to define and compose
    infinite images, we will explore some of them later. But for now
    let's just render that fascinating image.

    {2:rendering Rendering}

    An infinite image alone cannot be rendered. We need a {e finite}
    view rectangle and a specification of that view's physical size on
    the render target. These informations are coupled together with an
    image to form a {!Vgr.renderable}.

    Renderables can be given to a renderer for display via the
    function {!Vgr.render}.  Renderers are created with {!Vgr.create}
    and need a {{!Vgr.target}render target} value that defines the
    concrete renderer implementation used (PDF, SVG, HTML canvas etc.).

    The following function outputs the unit square of [gray] on a
    30x30 millimeters SVG target in the file [/tmp/vg-basics.svg]:
{[let svg_of_usquare i =
  let size = Size2.v 30. 30. in
  let view = Box2.unit in
  try
    let oc = open_out "/tmp/vg-basics.svg" in
    let r = Vgr.create (Vgr_svg.target ()) (`Channel oc) in
    try
      ignore (Vgr.render r (`Image (size, view, i)));
      ignore (Vgr.render r `End);
      close_out oc
    with e -> close_out oc; raise e
  with Sys_error e -> prerr_endline e

let () = svg_of_usquare gray]}
    The result should be an SVG image with a gray square
    like this:
{%html: <img src="../_assets/doc-gray-square.png"
             style="width:30mm; height:30mm;"/> %}

    {2:coordinates Coordinate space}

    [Vg]'s cartesian coordinate space has its origin at the bottom
    left with the x-axis pointing right, the y-axis pointing up. It
    has no units, you define what they mean to you. However a
    {{!Vgr.renderable}renderable} implicitely defines a physical unit
    for [Vg]'s coordinate space: the corners of the specified view
    rectangle are mapped on a rectangular area of the given physical
    size on the target.

    {2:scissors Scissors and glue}

    Constant images can be boring. To make things more interesting
    [Vg] gives you scissors: the {!I.cut} combinator.

    This combinator takes a finite area of the plane defined by a path
    [path] (more on paths later) and a source image [img] to define the
    image [I.cut path img] that has the color of the source image in the
    area defined by the path and the invisible transparent black color
    ({!Gg.Color.void}) everywhere else. In other words [I.cut path img]
    represents this function:
{[
fun pt -> if inside path pt then img pt else Color.void
]}
    The following code cuts a circle of radius [0.4] centered in the
    unit square in the [gray] image defined before.
{[
let circle = P.empty |> P.circle (P2.v 0.5 0.5) 0.4
let gray_circle = I.cut circle gray
]}
    Rendered by [svg_of_usquare] the result is:

{%html: <img src="../_assets/doc-gray-circle.png"
             style="width:30mm; height:30mm;"/> %}

    Note that the background white color surrounding the circle does
    not belong to the image itself, it is the color of the webpage
    background against which the image is composited. Your eyes
    require a wavelength there and {!Gg.Color.void} cannot provide it.

    {!I.cut} has an optional [area] argument of type {!P.area} that
    determines how a path should be interpreted as an area of the
    plane. The default value is [`Anz], which means that it uses the
    non-zero winding number rule and for [circle] that defines its
    interior.

    But the [circle] path can also be seen as defining a thin outline
    area around the ideal mathematical circle of [circle]. This can be
    specified by using an outline area `O o. The value [o] of type
    {!P.outline} defines various parameters that define the outline
    area; for example its width. The following code cuts the [circle]
    outline area of width [0.04] in an infinite black image.

{[
let circle_outline =
  let area = `O { P.o with P.width = 0.04 } in
  let black = I.const Color.black in
  I.cut ~area circle black
]}

    Below is the result and again, the white you see here is in
    fact {!Gg.Color.void}.

{%html: <img src="../_assets/doc-circle-outline.png"
             style="width:30mm; height:30mm;"/> %}

    {!I.cut} gives us scissors but to combine the results of cuts we
    need some glue: the {!I.blend} combinator. This combinator takes
    two infinite images [front] and [back] and defines an image
    [I.blend front back] that has the colors of [front] alpha blended
    on top of those of [back]. [I.blend front back] represents
    this function:
{[
let i' = fun pt -> Color.blend (front pt) (back pt)
]}
    If we blend [circle_outline] on top of [gray_circle]:
{[
let dot = I.blend circle_outline gray_circle
]}
    We get:

{%html: <img src="../_assets/doc-dot.png"
             style="width:30mm; height:30mm;"/> %}

    The order of arguments in {!I.blend} is defined so that images can
    be blended using the left-associative composition operator
    [|>]. That is [dot] can also be written as follows:
{[
let dot = gray_circle |> I.blend circle_outline
]}

    This means that with [|>] and {!I.blend} left to right order in
    code maps to back to front image blending.

    {2:transforming Transforming images}

    The combinators {!I.move}, {!I.rot}, {!I.scale}, and {!I.tr} allow
    to perform arbitrary
    {{:http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AffineTransformation.html}affine
    transformations} on an image. For example the image [I.move v i]
    is [i] but translated by the vector [v], that is the following
    function:
{[
fun pt -> img (V2.(pt - v))
]}
    The following example uses [I.move]. The function [scatter_plot]
    takes a list of points and returns a scatter plot of the
    points. First we define a [dot] around the origin, just a black
    circle of diameter [pt_width].  Second we define the function [mark]
    that given a point returns an image with [dot] at that
    point and [blend_mark] that blends a [mark] at a point on an image.
    Finally we blend all the marks toghether.
{[
let scatter_plot pts pt_width =
  let dot =
    let circle = P.empty |> P.circle P2.o (0.5 *. pt_width) in
    I.const Color.black |> I.cut circle
  in
  let mark pt = dot |> I.move pt in
  let blend_mark acc pt = acc |> I.blend (mark pt) in
  List.fold_left blend_mark I.void pts
]}
    Note that [dot] is defined outside [mark], this means that all [mark]s
    share the same [dot], doing so allows renderers to perform space
    and time optimizations. For example the SVG renderer will output a single
    [circle] path shared by all marks.

    Here's the result of [scatter_point] on 800 points with coordinates
    on independent normal distributions.
{%html: <img src="../_assets/doc-scatter-plot.png"
             style="width:40mm; height:40mm;"/> %}

    {2:paths Paths}

    Paths are used to define areas of the plane. A path is an
    immutable value of type {!path} which is a list of disconnected
    subpaths. A {e subpath} is a list of directed and connected curved
    segments.

    To build a path you start with the empty path {!P.empty}, give it
    to {!P.sub} to start a new subpath and give the result to
    {!P.line}, {!P.qcurve}, {!P.ccurve}, {!P.earc} or {!P.close} to
    add a new segment and so forth.

    Path combinators take the path they act upon as the last argument
    so that the left-associative operator [|>] can be used to
    construct paths.

    The image below is made by cutting the outline of the single path [p]
    defined hereafter.
{%html: <img src="../_assets/doc-subpaths.png"
             style="width:30mm; height:30mm;"/> %}
{[
let p =
  let rel = true in
  P.empty |>
  P.sub (P2.v 0.1 0.5) |>
    P.line (P2.v 0.3 0.5) |>
    P.qcurve ~rel (P2.v 0.2 0.5) (P2.v 0.2 0.0) |>
    P.ccurve ~rel (P2.v 0.0 (-. 0.5)) (P2.v 0.1 (-. 0.5)) (P2.v 0.3 0.0) |>
    P.earc ~rel (Size2.v 0.1 0.2) (P2.v 0.15 0.0) |>
  P.sub (P2.v 0.18 0.26) |>
    P.qcurve ~rel (P2.v (0.01) (-0.1)) (P2.v 0.1 (-. 0.05)) |>
    P.close |>
  P.sub (P2.v 0.65 0.8) |>
    P.line ~rel (P2.v 0.1 (-. 0.05))
in
let area = `O { P.o with P.width = 0.01 } in
I.const Color.black |> I.cut ~area p
]}

    Except for {!P.close} which has no other argument but a path, the
    last point argument before the path argument is always the concrete end
    point of the segment. When [true] the optional [rel] argument
    indicates that the coordinates given to the constructor are
    expressed relative to end point of the last segment (or [P2.o] if
    there is no such segment).

    Note that after a [P.close] or on the [P.empty] path, the
    call to {!P.sub} can be omitted. In that case an implicit
    [P.sub P2.o] is introduced.

    For more information about how paths are intepreted as
    areas, consult their {{!sempaths}semantics}.

(** {1:semantics Semantics}

    The following notations and definitions are used to give precise
    meaning to the images and the combinators.

    {2:semcolors Colors}

    The semantics of colors is the one ascribed to
    {{!Gg.Color.t}[Gg.color]}: colors are in a {e linearized} sRGBA space.

    {3:semstops Color stops}

    A value of type {!Gg.Color.stops} specifies a color at each point
    of the 1D {e unit} space. It is defined by a list of pairs
    [(t]{_i}[, c]{_i}[)] where [t]{_i} is a value from [0] to [1] and
    [c]{_i} the corresponding color at that value. Colors at points
    between [t]{_i} and [t]{_i+1} are linearly interpolated between
    [c]{_i} and [c]{_i+1}. If [t]{_i} lies outside [0] to [1]
    or if [t]{_i-1} >= [t]{_i} the semantics is undefined.

    Given a stops value [stops = \[][(t]{_0}[, c]{_0}[);]
    [(t]{_1}[,c]{_1}[);] ... [(t]{_n}[, c]{_n}[)][\]] and any point
    [t] of 1D space, the semantic function:

    \[\] [: Gg.Color.stops -> float -> Gg.color]

    maps them to a color value written \[[stops]\]{_t}
    as follows.

    {ul
      {- \[[]\]{_t} = [(0, 0, 0, 0)] for any [t]}
      {- \[[stops]\]{_t} [= c]{_0} if [t < t]{_0}.}
      {- \[[stops]\]{_t} [= c]{_n} if [t >= t]{_n}.}
      {- \[[stops]\]{_t} [= (1-u)c]{_i}[ + uc]{_i+1}
      with [u = (t - t]{_i}[)/(t]{_i+1}[-t]{_i}[)]
      if [t]{_i} [<= t <] [t]{_i+1}}}

    {2:semimages Images}

    Values of type {!image} represent maps from the infinite
    2D euclidian space to {{!semcolors}colors}. Given an image [i] and
    a point [pt] of the plane the semantic function

    \[\][: image -> Gg.p2 -> Gg.color]

    maps them to a color value written \[[i]\]{_[pt]} representing the
    image's color at this point.

    {2:sempaths Paths and areas}

    A value of type {!path} is a list of subpaths. A subpath is a list
    of {e directed} and connected curved {e segments}. Subpaths are
    disconnected from each other and may (self-)intersect.

    A path and a value of type {!P.area} defines a finite area of the
    2D euclidian space. Given an area specification [a], a path [p]
    and a point [pt], the semantic function:

    \[\]: [P.area -> path -> Gg.p2 -> bool]

    maps them to a boolean value written \[[a], [p]\]{_[pt]}
    that indicates whether [pt] belongs to the area or not.

    The semantics of area rules is as follows:
    {ul

    {- \[[`Anz], [p]\]{_[pt]} is [true] iff the winding number of [p]
        around [pt] is non zero. To determine the winding number cast
        a ray from [pt] to infinity in any direction (just make sure
        the ray doesn't intersect [p] tangently or at a
        singularity). Starting with zero add one for each intersection
        with a counter-clockwise oriented segment of [p] and substract
        one for each clockwise ones. The resulting sum is the
        winding number. This is usually refered to as the {e non-zero winding
        rule} and is the default for {!I.cut}.
{%html: <img src="../_assets/doc-anz.png" style="width:90mm; height:30mm;"/> %}}
    {- \[[`Aeo], [p]\]{_[pt]} is [true] iff the number of
        intersections of [p] with a ray cast from [pt] to infinity in
        any direction is odd (just make sure the ray doesn't intersect
        [p] tangently or at a singularity). This is usually refered
        to as the {e even-odd rule}.
{%html: <img src="../_assets/doc-aeo.png" style="width:90mm; height:30mm;"/> %}}
    {- \[[`O o], [p]\]{_[pt]} is [true] iff [pt] is in the outline
        area of [p] as defined by the value [o] of type {!type:P.outline}.
        See {!semoutlines}, {!semjoins}, {!semcaps}, {!semdashes}.}}

        {3:semoutlines Outline areas}

        The outline area of a path is the union of its subpaths
        outline areas. A subpath outline area is inside the parallel
        curves at a distance [o.width / 2] of its path segments that
        are joined accoring to the join style [o.join] (see below) and
        closed at the subpath end points with a cap style [o.cap] (see
        below). The outline area of a subpath can also be chopped at
        regular intervals according to the [o.dashes] parameter (see
        below).

        {4:semjoins Segment jointures}

        The shape of subpath segment jointures is specified in
        [o.join] by a value of type {!P.join}. From left to right:
{%html: <img src="../_assets/doc-joins.png"
             style="width:90mm; height:30mm;"/> %}
        {ul
        {- [`Miter], the outer parallel curves are extended until they
           meet unless the joining angle is smaller than
           [o.miter_angle] in which case the join is converted to a
           bevel.}
        {- [`Round], joins the outer parallel curves by a semicircle
           centered at the end point with a diameter equal to [o.width].}
        {- [`Bevel], joins the outer parallel curves by a segment.}}

        {4:semcaps Subpath caps}

        The shape of subpath (or dashes) end points is specified in
        [o.cap] by a value of type {!P.cap}. From left to right:
{%html: <img src="../_assets/doc-caps.png" style="width:90mm; height:20mm;"/> %}
        {ul
        {- [`Butt], end points are square and extend only to the
           exact end point of the path.}
        {- [`Round], end points are rounded by a semicircle at
           the end point with a diameter equal to [o.width].}
        {- [`Square], end points are square and extend by a distance
           equal to half [o.width].}}

        {4:semdashes Outline dashes}

        The path outline area can be chopped at regular intervals by
        spefiying a value [(off, pat)] of type {!P.dashes} in [o.dashes].

        The {e dash pattern} [pat] is a list of lengths that specify
        the length of alternating dashes and gaps (starting with
        dashes). The {e dash offset} [off] is a {e positive} offset
        that indicates where to start in the dash pattern at the
        beginning of a subpath.  *)

(** {1:examples Examples}

Many examples of images and their source can be found in the
{{:http://erratique.ch/software/vg/demos/rhtmlc.html}online version}
of [Vg]'s test image database. Clicking on the title of an image brings
you to its definition.

The following examples show for each renderer the minimal code
needed to output an image. This code can also be found in the [test]
directory of the distribution.

{2:minpdf Minimal PDF output}

The file [min_pdf.ml] contains the following mostly self-explanatory
code. We first define an image and then render it. For the latter
step we define some meta-data for the image, a function to print
rendering warnings and then render the image on stdout.

{[
open Gg
open Vg

(* 1. Define your image *)

let aspect = 1.618
let size = Size2.v (aspect *. 100.) 100. (* mm *)
let view = Box2.v P2.o (Size2.v aspect 1.)
let image = I.const (Color.v_srgb 0.314 0.784 0.471)

(* 2. Render *)

let () =
  let title = "Vgr_pdf minimal example" in
  let description = "Emerald Color" in
  let xmp = Vgr.xmp ~title ~description () in
  let warn w = Vgr.pp_warning Format.err_formatter w in
  let r = Vgr.create ~warn (Vgr_pdf.target ~xmp ()) (`Channel stdout) in
  ignore (Vgr.render r (`Image (size, view, image)));
  ignore (Vgr.render r `End)
]}

This can be compiled with:

{2:minhtmlc Minimal HTML canvas output}

The file [min_htmlc.ml] contains the following code. Step by step we have:
{ol
{- Define an image.}
{- Create and add to the DOM an anchor [a] that will parent the canvas.
   This will allow to download a (usually PNG) file of the image.}
{- Create a canvas element [c] and add it as a child of [a].}
{- Create a renderer [r] targeting the canvas [c].}
{- Render the image.}
{- Ask the canvas for an image data URL and set it as the the link of the
   anchor.}}

This file needs to be compiled to byte code and then [js_of_ocaml]
must be applied. This can be achieved with:
{[> ocamlfind ocamlc \
  -package gg,vg,vg.htmlc,brr \
  -linkpkg -o min_htmlc.byte min_htmlc.ml \
  && js_of_ocaml min_htmlc.byte]}

Finally we need a minimal HTML file that references our final
javascript [min_htmlc.js]. The following one will do:
{v
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,
                                 initial-scale=1.0">
