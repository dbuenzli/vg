synopsis: "Declarative 2D vector graphics for OCaml"
description: """\
Vg is a declarative 2D vector graphics library. Images are values that
denote functions mapping points of the cartesian plane to colors and
combinators are provided to define and compose them.

Renderers for PDF, SVG, Cairo and the HTML canvas are distributed with the
module. An API allows to implement new renderers.

Vg is distributed under the ISC license. Vg and the SVG renderer
depend on [Gg]. The PDF renderer depends on [Uutf] and [Otfm], the
HTML canvas renderer depends on [Brr], the Cairo renderer depends on
[cairo2].
